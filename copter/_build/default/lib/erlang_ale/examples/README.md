# Overview

These examples demonstrate simple uses of Erlang/ALE. To compile then, just
run:

    make

The examples can be run via Makefile targets.

# gpio_counter

For this example, connect a button to GPIO 17 and another button to GPIO 22.
Connect GPIO 23 and GPIO 24 to LEDs. Pressing the button on GPIO 22 will increase
the "count" on the LEDs and the GPIO 17 button will decrease it.
